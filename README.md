# Diabetes Prediction System

**Project Overview**

This project implements a Diabetes Prediction System using Machine Learning.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained on medical diagnostic data to predict whether a patient is diabetic or non-diabetic.
The trained pipeline is deployed as an interactive web application using Gradio.

**Deployment**

Gradio is used for interactive deployment

The app allows users to input medical parameters and receive:

i)Diabetes prediction

ii)Probability score
